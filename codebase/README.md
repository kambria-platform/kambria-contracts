# CODEBASE CONTRACT

## Introduction
Modules can be linked to KI’s distributed module registry (the “Kambria Code Base”) which is a smart
contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Registering the module only needs a publicly-accessible URI to the
repo, and a unique name. This process does not certify any particular amount of work done or ownership,
but links the repo into the Kambria Code Base. Furthermore, every module/repository has the ability to
hold, receive and send funds, and participate in on-chain mechanisms (voting, signaling, staking, etc.).
